How It Works

    Marks Input: The script prompts the user to enter the student's marks.
    Grade Calculation: The script calculates the grade based on the following criteria:
        A for marks greater than 79
        B for marks between 60 and 79
        C for marks between 49 and 59
        D for marks between 40 and 48
        E for marks below 40
    Validation: The script checks if the input is a valid number between 0 and 100. If not, it prompts the user to enter a valid number.
